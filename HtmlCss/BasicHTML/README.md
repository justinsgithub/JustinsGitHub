# HTML BASICS
- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
- Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
- HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
- Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing `<body>` tags.
- Headings and sub-headings, `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.
- `<p>`, `<span>` and `<div>` tags specify text or blocks.
- The `<em>` and `<strong>` tags are used to emphasize text.
- Line breaks are created with the `<br>` tag.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are numbered and unordered lists (`<ul>`) are bulleted.
- Images (`<img>`) and videos (`<video>`) can be added by linking to an existing source.

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
- The `<html>` element will contain all of your HTML code.
- Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the `<head>` of the page.
- You can add a title to your web page by using the `<title>` element, inside of the head.
- A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
- Anchor tags (`<a>`) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
- You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using `<a>` tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
- Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
- Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
- Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: `<!-- comment -->`.

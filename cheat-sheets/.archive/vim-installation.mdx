# Vim text-editor

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

Vim is a highly efficient, powerful, & configurable text editor. Originates from the text editing program "vi".

#### Install Vim from source
*This is using a Debian-based Linux system, commands may vary by distribution*

<Callout>
if any error messages pop up after the "make" command, it is most-likely because we need to install packages that Vim depends on. The error message will tell us the package names we are missing. 
</Callout>
<Callout>
run "sudo apt install" with the package names to fix the error. Then run the "make" command again, BEFORE RUNNING "sudo make install".

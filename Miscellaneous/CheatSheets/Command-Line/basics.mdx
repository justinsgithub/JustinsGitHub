# Computing Basics 

## Binary, Bits, Bytes
> A the lowest level computers only understand 1's and 0's 

- bi-nary comes from the fact that it only uses 2 digits, 1 and 0. 
- computers communicate using electricity through wires and circuits
- this gives computers the ability to understand binary data, by knowing if the signal in the wire is off or on 
- this lets computers understand things like 
> yes and no 

> true and false

> on and off 

> 1 and 0

- adding more wires allows for more combinations of 1's and 0's and therefore more complex information

> counting in binary

- the binary number system seems very different compared to the usual decimal system
- they are similiar in how they are positional systems, they give numbers value based on their position
- the more places to the left the number is, the higher its value
- the decimal system multiplies by 10 for each place (the power of 10)
- the binary system multiplies by 2 (the power of 2)

- all odd numbers in the binary system will end in a 1

|      32       |         1  0 0 0 0 0 |
|      64       |      1  0  0 0 0 0 0 |

- a byte of information
|     128       |   1  0  0  0 0 0 0 0 |

- the on or off state of a wire is the smallest piece of information a computer can store. 
- this single piece of information is known as a "bit"
- every place in a  binary number is 1 bit
- 8 bits of information makes up a byte of information

# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

## NODES 

- a node contains data and links to other nodes
- node data can be of any type including nothing / null
- the link / links in a node are sometimes called pointers
- a node "points" to another node
- data structures typically implement nodes with one or more links
- oftentimes a node can only be linked to from a single other node

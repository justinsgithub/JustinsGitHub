# JavaScript Basics (JS)

- console is a panel that displays messages
- data is printed, or logged, to the console

- 7 fundamental data types
- strings
- numbers
- booleans
- null
- undefined
- symbol
- object
- 
- Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
- arithmetic operators + -  *  / %
- Objects include instances of data types 
- Objects can have properties
- properties are stored information 
- properties are denoted with . after the name of the object
- Objects can have methods which perform actions
- We can access properties and methods by using the . dot operator
- Built-in objects are collections of methods and properties


- Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name
- Variables are stored in memory.
- The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
- let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it might be reassigned
- const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value
- Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined
- Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable
- The typeof keyword returns a string with the data type of the passed value

- if statement executes a task if specified condition evaluates to true.
- if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
- add more conditions using else if statements.
- comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
- && checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
- || checks if either provided expression is truthy.
-  ! switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
- ? is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
- switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements
-  switch statment break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.

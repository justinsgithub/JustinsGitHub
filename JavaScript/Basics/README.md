- Built-in objects are collections of methods and properties


- Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name
- Variables are stored in memory.
- The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
- let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it might be reassigned
- const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value
- Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined
- Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable
- The typeof keyword returns a string with the data type of the passed value
